1.Create git repo and clone it in local.
2.Create mycode.py and code to it.(It will save a csv file to a new "data" folder.)
3.Do a git add-commit-push before intializing dvc.
#pip install dvc
4.Now we do "dvc init"(create .dvcignore ,.dvc)
5.Now do "mkdir S3" (create a new s3 directory)
6.Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7.Next "dvc add data/"
   Now it will ask to do:("git run -r --cached "data") and "git commit -m "stop[ tracking data"]
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC again to handle.
8.Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc ) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9.Now -"dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10.Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data,check changes via "dvc status"
